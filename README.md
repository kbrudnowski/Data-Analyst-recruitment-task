<h1> Recruitment task for Junior Data Analyst position </h1>

The homework assignment is a simplified version of the problems you can face on this position. 
The company value independence, good intuition and thinking skills, thus part of the assignment is open-ended without an answer key. We will be working on a dataset of meteorite landings in the US (https://data.nasa.gov/resource/gh4g-9sfh.json, documentation: https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh). 
Here is what to do with it:

1. Write a Python program that takes the json data and returns a CSV file with the data.
2. Upload the generated CSV file into Google Sheets.
3. In a new sheet, create a pivot table that shows how many meteors of a particular class fell in a given year.
4. Assume that the spreadsheet is a SQL database. Write an SQL query:
  - which will return the average mass of meteors in each class.
  - which will return the classes of meteors whose average weight is less than 5000.
5. Using Google Data Studio, create a visualization of the spreadsheet data:
  - Meteorite counts over time.
  - Your own visualisation that you think best captures the sense of the above dataset.

Good luck!
